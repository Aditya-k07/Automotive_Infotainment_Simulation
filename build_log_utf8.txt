  By not providing 
"FindQt6.cmake" in 
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this 
project has
  asked CMake to find a 
package configuration 
file provided by "Qt6", 
but
  CMake did not find 
one.

  Could not find a 
package configuration 
file provided by "Qt6" 
with any of
  the following names:

    Qt6Config.cmake
    qt6-config.cmake

  Add the installation 
prefix of "Qt6" to 
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or 
set "Qt6_DIR"
  to a directory 
containing one of the 
above files.  If "Qt6" 
provides a
  separate development 
package or SDK, be sure 
it has been installed.
